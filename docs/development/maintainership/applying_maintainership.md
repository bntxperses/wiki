# Applying for Official Maintainership

Congratulations, if you already booted Halcyon for Your device!

To maintain **Halcyon** officially, you have to:
1. Make sure you completed our [Maintainership Requirements](/development/maintainership/requirements).
2. If you believe you meet all the requirements stated in the wiki, you can create a Halcyon Account through [@HanabiChanBot](https://t.me/HanabiChanBot) by typing:
`/register USERNAME`.
3. Then, send `/apply` and follow the instructions provided by the bot.
4. Our team will review your application, and reach you as soon as possible.

See you soon on our Maintainers chat!
